# fe-angularjs-test-1.0.0

Hello there!

This is a test app. You can use it as a base of building other more complex applications.

For example in building a website for news. There are articles and categories for them.

Main technologies used: AngularJS and Bootstrap

How to run the app: The simpliest way is to use Brackets editor, it is free and creates a local server only in clicking one button.

If you need help in building more complex software and real time synchronization apps, please contact this email:
